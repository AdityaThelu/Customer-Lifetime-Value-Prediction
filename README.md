# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer lifetime value (CLTV) using machine learning techniques. It utilizes Jupyter notebooks to explore data, build predictive models, and analyze results. 

## Features

* **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** The project includes Jupyter notebooks for analyzing and preparing customer data for CLTV prediction.
* **Predictive Modeling:** The project implements various machine learning models to predict customer lifetime value.
* **Model Evaluation:** The notebooks evaluate the performance of the developed models using appropriate metrics.
* **Documentation:** The project provides PDF documents that explain the CLTV prediction process and methodology.

## Installation

This project uses Python. You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebooks:** Locate the Jupyter notebooks (`CLTV_R2 (1).ipynb` and `CLTV (1).ipynb`) within the project directory.
2. **Run the notebooks:** Execute the cells in the notebooks sequentially to explore data, build models, and analyze results.
3. **Review the Documentation:** Refer to the PDF documents (`Predictive Modeling for Real-Time Customer Lifetime Value.pdf` and `CLTV Prediction.pdf`) for detailed explanations of the project methodology and results.
